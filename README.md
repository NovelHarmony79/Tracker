# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Creator's Note:

This app was made to track the location of the user without the need to stay on a single tab, essentially allowing the app to track the user in the background. 

The app will then try to connect to one of our Raspberry Pi's that is running a hotspot via Flask server. It will then send the location data of the user to the Raspberry Pi.

So far, only the location tracking function is completely finished. In the future, I would like for the data transferring via hotspot to be finished. The code that I have written for the data sharing is only a basis on what the code should look like, and is not actually functional. In the future, this code should be improved until functional, before working on any extra features.
